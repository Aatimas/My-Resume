    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> <h2>Reading </h2>
            <p>I love reading in my spare time, I mostly read enjoyable web novels or light novels written by Chinese,Japanese and Korean authors.</p>   
        
            <h3>My top 3 Novels of all time</h3>
            <hr />
            <ol>
              <li><h4>Overgeared, Korean</h4>
                 <p>
                   All hail god grid. This is one of the most amazing novels ever. The author is
                   a genius who strings together plot points like a Master Tailor. The world
                   building is so good, You would suspect the author to be an expert builder. I'd
                   rate this novel an Only One.
                 </p>
               </li>
           
              <li><h4>Reincarnation of The Strongest Sword God, Chinese</h4>
                 <p>
                   A very promising title. While the novel has it's flaws, I would not want to
                   miss reading this one. If only Lucky Old Cat could keep up with the complex
                   and massive story he himself created, maybe we'd have a true masterpiece to
                   read. This story is like a unfinished myth tier item, while incomplete it
                   still packs enough punch compared to everything else.

              </li>
            
               <li><h4>Versatile Mage, Chinese</h4>
                 <p>
                   A novel whose ending I don't particularly fancy. But the ending is not all
                   there is to a novel. The better part of the novel is so good, it is worth
                   reading. I suspect the author is a massive simp and especially loves the cold
                   beauties after reading that ending.
